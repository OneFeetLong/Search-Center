SEARCH CENTER

This is an open source app, recreating an older extension by the same name that is no longer on the Chrome store. I have no affiliation or profit-incentive for this extension I made it for my own use and others to replace it.

To use it, get your URL by searching 'searchcenter' in the websites search function.
For example, google's URL for this app would need: https://www.google.com/search?q=searchcenter

This is my first real project, I am not a coder. If there are any issues or bug fix requests please send them through here on Github or email to chienlibre@protonmail.com
